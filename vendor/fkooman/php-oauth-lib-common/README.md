# Introduction
This library aims to contain all classes that can be shared between:

* [php-oauth](https://github.com/fkooman/php-oauth)
* [php-oauth-client](https://github.com/fkooman/php-oauth-client)
* [php-oauth-lib-rs](https://github.com/fkooman/php-oauth-lib-rs)

At the moment this project is in the stage of collection shareable code and 
have the projects use it instead of their own contained copy.
